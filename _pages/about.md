<i>My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in model optimization techniques for deep learning. I am doing research to enhance the performance of machine learning applications on both Software and Hardware level.</i>

Since the start of September 2020, I am doing my master thesis in the [Integrated Systems Lab](https://iis.ee.ethz.ch/) at [ETH-Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Luca Benini](https://iis.ee.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MTk0MjM0.TGlzdC8xOTgzLDk5MDE4ODk4MA==.html) to optimize Ternary Neural Networks for Resource-Efficient AI Applications. 
  
In the past, I was working as a researcher at the [Integrated Systems](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lis/home/) department of [Technical Universiry of Munich](www.tum.de) with [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Walter Stechele](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lis/persons/management/walter-stechele/) and [Dr. Sabine Ott](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/person/18084/2169) to enhance framerate of camera by using deep neural network on FPGA.

Previously, I was a Research Intern at [BMW's Autonomous Driving Campus](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/innovation/technologies-and-mobility/autonomes-fahren/campus.html) where I did research on Hardware and Software optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks. I explored different optimization techniques to reduce power consumption and memory footprint of machine learning models.

In September 2019, I went to a summer school ["Ferienakademie"](https://www.ferienakademie.de/en/home-2/) for two weeks where we did some research on using autonomous drones for sustainability. We made a prototype to monitor water pollution in Durnholz lake in Sarntal. We published a research paper on our work in [3rd IEEE-Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems](https://events.tuni.fi/icps2020/) conference recently. You can read the research paper and more details [here](https://saqibjaved1.github.io/publication/swarm).
